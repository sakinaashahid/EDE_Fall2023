## Directions
1.  Rename this file `SakinaShahid_A01_Introduction.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.


## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project" (If you don't see this option, try restarting RStudio.)


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: 
I took Statistical Modeling here at Duke as a first year MEM student and I used R in that class. As an undergraduate, I had taken a course which lightly used R as a mathematical tool to input numbers and formulas. I have no prior experience using Git.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: 
I feel confident in being able to troubleshoot problems and use the R interface, for the most part.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: 
 I am using R as a virtual container instead of having it installed on my laptop which makes me nervous. I haven't worked with large datasets so I feel apprehensive in regards to data wrangling.


## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
